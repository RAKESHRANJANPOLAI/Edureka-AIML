# ner_crf

*ner_crf* is a Jupyter Notebook describing named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields (CRFs), implemented using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)/[sklearn-crfsuite](https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).


## Dependencies

*ner_crf* is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), and so a recent version of *python3* should be downloaded before using it. Downloads for *python* can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/ (version 3.5.1 recommended). You also need to be able to run Jupyter Notebooks (see [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)).

The following *python* libraries will also be needed to run the *ner_crf* notebook:
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [sklearn-crfsuite](https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [PyPrind](https://pypi.org/project/PyPrind/)
